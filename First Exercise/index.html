            <p>A library is a collection of sources of information and similar resources, made accessible to a defined community for reference or borrowing.It provides physical or digital access to material, and may be a physical building or room, or a virtual
                space, or both.A library's collection can include books, periodicals, newspapers, manuscripts, films, maps, prints, documents, microform, CDs, cassettes, videotapes, DVDs, Blu-ray Discs, e-books, audiobooks, databases, and other formats.
                Libraries range in size from a few shelves of books to several million items. In Latin and Greek, the idea of a bookcase is represented by Bibliotheca derivatives of these mean library. in many modern languages</p>
            <p>A library is organized for use and maintained by a public body, an institution, a corporation, or a private individual. Public and institutional collections and services may be intended for use by people who choose not to—or cannot afford
                to—purchase an extensive collection themselves, who need material no individual can reasonably be expected to have, or who require professional assistance with their research. In addition to providing materials, libraries also provide
                the services of librarians who are experts at finding and organizing information and at interpreting information needs. </p>
